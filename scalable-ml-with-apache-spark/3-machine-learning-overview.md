# What is Machine Learning?
1. Learning patterns and relationships in your data without explicitly programming them
2. Derive an approximation function to map features to an output or relate them to each other
# Types of Machine Learning
## Supervised Learning
- Labelled data (known as function input)
- Regression (a continuous/ordinal-discrete output)
- Classification (a categorical output)
## Unsupervised Learning
- Unlabelled data (no known function output)
- Clustering (categorise records based on features)
- Dimensionality reduction (reduce feature space)
## Semi-supervised Learning
- Labelled and unlabelled data, mostly unlabelled
- Combines supervised learning and unsupervised learning
- Commonly trying to label the unlabelled data to be used in another round of training
## Reinforcement Learning
* States, actions, and rewards
* Useful for exploring spaces and exploiting information to maximise expected cumulative rewards
* Frequently utilises neural networks and deep learning
# Machine Learning Workflow
1. Define Business Case
2. Define Success, Constraints and Infrastructure
3. Data Collation
4. Feature Engineering
5. Modelling
6. Deployment
