# Importance of Data Visualisation
- Just because multiple datasets have the same mean, standard deviation and regression line, does not mean they are the same.
- They can be qualitatively different
- This is known as Anscombe's Quartet, four different data sets that have nearly identical descriptive statistics, yet have very different distributions and appear very different when graphed.
