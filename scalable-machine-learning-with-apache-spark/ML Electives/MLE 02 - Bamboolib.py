# MAGIC # Data Exploration and Transformation with *bamboolib*
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 8080 Labs was acquired in 2021 by Databricks. This brought the popular tool `bamboolib` into the Databricks ecosystem. As of the release of DBR 11.0. [bamboolib](https://docs.databricks.com/notebooks/bamboolib.html) is supported on Databricks clusters. Bamboolib is a **low-code** tool that accelerates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and exploration with visual tools, as well as the ability to output code needed to perform the analysis after completion.

# MAGIC Bamboolib works directly with pandas dataframes, so we'll load the San Francisco Airbnb dataset and pull it into pandas for exploration.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **💡 Question: if your dataset is too large to pull into a Pandas DataFrame directly, what should you do?**

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Suppose we want to fit a **Linear Regression** to the `price` column. Let's use bamboolib to explore our dataset and find the right regressors to include in the model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC There are two main ways to access the bamboolib interface. The first is a button which appears above any printed Pandas DataFrame. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Use the following cell to print `airbnb_pd` and click the green **"Show bamboolib UI"** button to access the bamboo GUI.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Click the **"Explore DataFrame"** button. Notice that we can see some summary values associated with each column of our DataFrame. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - We're interested in predicting the `price` column, so click on the row that corresponds to `price`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The **"Overview"** subtab for `price` will appear automatically with some summary statistics and a Histogram. You may notice the `price` values are heavily right skewed.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Click on the **"Predictors"** tab to see the **Predictive Power Score (PPS)** for each variable regressed against `price`. The PPS ranges from 0 (low predictive power) to 1 (high predictive power). The highest Predictor in the dataset is `bedrooms` though only has a score of 0.139. Let's take a closer look at the relationship between `price` and `bedrooms`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Click the **"Bivariate Plots"** subtab and select `price` and `bedrooms` as the plotting variables. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Click on **"B predicts A"** and look at the Scatter plot. Here we can see a general linear trend that as the number of bedrooms increases the price of the Airbnb increases as well. However, we can also see there are some very expensive outliers! 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We may be able to better fit the data by considering the `log(price)` rather than the `price` itself. Let's keep this plot here and move to the next cell to start manipulating our data.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Create a new variable with bamboolib
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's look at how to add a new variable to our data as we start to clean and prepare our dataset for our machine learning model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Print again the `airbnb_pd` DataFrame and open the bamboolib GUI.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - In the "Search actions" box type "formula" and click on the option **"New Column Formula"** which will open a side-box popup. For the column name type `log_price` and for the column formula use `np.log(price)` and click the **"Execute"** button.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Click on the **"Explore DataFrame"** button and select the row associated with `log_price`. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Click the **"Predictors"** subtab. Notice that the variable `accommodates` now has a PPS of 0.243, a major improvement over our best previous score of 0.139! You should see that `price` has almost a perfect PPS for `log_price`, that's expected. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Inspect correlation matrix
# MAGIC Other variables have better scores as well. There are high scores for `bedrooms`, `beds`, `room_type`, `host_total_listings_count`, and `bathrooms`, but might these variables be correlated with `accommodates`? If so, we shouldn't include all of them in our model because we would introduce multicollinearity. Let's investigate!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Go to the **"Exploration"** tab and select the **"Correlation Matrix"** subtab. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - In the **"Show"** box select the variables `accommodates`, `bedrooms`, `beds`, `host_total_listings_count`, and `bathrooms` (we can't select `room_type` for correlation as it is categorical), and click the Update button. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Use your cursor to hover over the heatmap and examine the Pearson correlation of `accomodates` with each of the other variables. If we include `accommodates` in our model we should leave out `bedrooms` and `beds` as they have high correlation values above 0.75. However, the correlations with `bathrooms` and `host_total_listings_count` are pretty weak at 0.35 and -0.03, so these are safe to include in our model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Save final state
# MAGIC To save our progress for future users, let's use a feature of bamboolib to export our code. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Go to the **"Data"** tab and look under the table of data to see a green **"Copy Code"** button. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Click that and paste the code into the next cell.

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC As we prepare to fit our linear regression, let's remove some columns that we don't need.
# MAGIC Use the below cell to execute `airbnb_pd` and open the bamboolib UI.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Drop and transform columns
# MAGIC
# MAGIC One of the columns which was of interest in the last cell but was categorical was the `room_type` column. 
# MAGIC Use the **"Explore DataFrame"** button and view the details of this column. There are 3 distinct values: `Entire home/apt`, `Private room`, and `Shared room`. The value of this categorical variable could be encoded as an **Ordinal Variable** since they have a natural order of preference. Highest preference for most people would be to have additional privacy. Let's create a new column to represent this.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - In the search actions box type "drop" and click **"Select or drop columns"**. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Select **"Drop"** in the "Choose" pop up box and specify the following columns to drop: `bedrooms`, `beds`, and `price`. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Specify `airbnb_reduced` as the new dataframe name. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Click **"Explore DataFrame"**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Under the **"Data"** tab select **"New Column Formula"** in the "Search actions box". Name your new variable `room_type_ord`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - For the formula we'll map the strings to integer values of increasing order with this formula; **`room_type.map({"Shared room" : 0, "Private room" : 1, "Entire home/apt" : 2})`**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Click **"Execute"**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Save final state
# MAGIC To save our progress for future users, let's use a feature of bamboolib to export our code.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Build training dataset
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now that we have made some progress with bamboolib, let's take a subset of this data to build a training dataset to train our simple model. 
# MAGIC We'll use bamboolib to select the following columns for training: `accommodation`, `room_type_ord`, `host_total_listings_count`, and `bathrooms` to predict `log_price`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To build our training dataset:
# MAGIC - Print again the airbnb_pd DataFrame by running the next code cell. Open the bamboolib GUI.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - In the search actions box type "drop" and click **"Select or drop columns"**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Choose: **Select**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Select following columns; `accommodates`, `room_type_ord`, `host_total_listings_count`, `bathrooms`, `log_price`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Change the **New dataframe name** to **`airbnb_training`**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Click **"Execute"** button.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Save final state
